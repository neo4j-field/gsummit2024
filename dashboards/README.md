# NeoDash

[NeoDash](https://neo4j.com/labs/neodash/) is an open-source, low-code Dashboard Builder for Neo4j. It lets you build an interactive dashboard with tables, graphs, bar charts, line charts, maps and more.

We're going to take our dataset and try to answer our 4 questions from the beginning of the workshop:

- [Question 1](model-questions/Question%201.md): What is the route from Operational Point X to Operational Point Y?
- [Question 2](model-questions/Question%202.md): What is an alternative route if an Operational Point on a route is closed?
- [Question 3](model-questions/Question%203.md): How many routes are affected if I need to upgrade an Operational Point?
- [Question 4](model-questions/Question%204.md): What POIs are along a route?

The likelihood is that we won't get through them all in this workshop, but they will be there for you to look at later!
