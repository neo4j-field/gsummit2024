# What POIs are along a route?

> Can we make revenue from referral commissions? Find busier routes during tourism season?

## Introduction

As we know from the [previous question](Question%203.md) - we don't have Route data, _but_ we do have `POI` (Point Of Interest) data and `Station` data, so what we can do is take a 'fake route' and see what POIs are on the 'route' and maybe see if we could sell some extra tickets.
